              \n \
              Firstly, the intersections on the road network were selected as candidates. \
              Intersection points were selected because the road inspectors would be able to drive to multiple directions and this would cover the road network more efficiently\
              compared to locating the inspectors in the middle of a road segment. This is possible by referring to the number of edges entering and leaving the nodes.\
              After this, a location which has another location within 500 meters range was removed. \
              This is to prevent multiple road inspectors being located too close to each other.\
              The figure below shows the overview and a zoomed-in example of the candidate points. The green cross points are the candidate points.\
              After the candidate point selection, 1936 candidate locations for the road inspectors were set, and these locations were used for the optimisation process.")

              For the path finding, the 'shortest_path_length' function in NetworkX was used. \
              This function calculates the shortest path between two nodes in the graph and returns the distance of the path. \

              The path betwenn a pair of candidate points and incident points with a euclidian distance of more than 50 km was not calculated \
              because it is not possible for the road inspectors to reach an incident that far in a short time, and that incident should be handled by a closer inspector. \
              For these pairs, a value of 1E9 meters. In addition, some pairs did not have possible path available because of the imcompleteness of the road network. \
              For these pairs, a value of 2E9 meters were assigned. These large values will prevent from these pairs being chosen (= an inspector handling an incindent) \
